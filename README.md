## Abstract
In recent years, significant advances in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and hyperspectral remote sensing
have spurred rapid and innovative developments in UAV-based
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification across a range of fields,
including environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, forest
health assessment, and disaster management. Compared to spaceborne platforms, the spectra of ground objects observed by UAV
platforms exhibit notable variations, presenting more pronounced
challenges for accurate classification. This article provides an indepth and systematic review of UAV HSI classification techniques,
systematically examining the evolution from traditional machine
learning approaches, such as sparse coding, compressed sensing,
and kernel methods, to cutting-edge deep learning frameworks,
including convolutional neural networks, Transformer models, recurrent neural networks, graph convolutional networks, generative
adversarial networks, and hybrid models. Although traditional
methods demonstrate effectiveness in certain scenarios, their limitations become increasingly apparent when dealing with highdimensional, nonlinear spectral data. In contrast, deep learningbased models excel at capturing intricate relationships between spectral and spatial features, significantly boosting classification
accuracy and emerging as the dominant paradigm in the field. The
WHU-Hi hyperspectral remote sensing dataset is utilized as a case
study to elucidate the advantages and limitations of various deep
learning methods through rigorous qualitative and quantitative
comparisons. The potential of UAV hyperspectral image classification techniques in addressing high-dimensional data and complex
scenarios is also thoroughly described. Furthermore, this article
delves into cutting-edge research trends, such as lightweight model
development, hyperspectral large models, multisource data fusion,
